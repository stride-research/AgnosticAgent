# Hybrid Tool Use Example

This example demonstrates:

- **Hybrid orchestration**: Combines sequential and parallel tool calls within a single agent workflow.
- **Realistic scenario**: The agent first determines required ingredients (sequential), then fetches prices for all ingredients in parallel.
- **Toolkit integration**: Tools are defined in a separate module and registered for agent use.

**Comparison:**
- Contrasts with the purely sequential and purely parallel tool examples by mixing both approaches.
- Highlights how agents can optimize for both logical order and efficiency in tool use.
