# File Upload Example

This example demonstrates:

- **File ingestion**: Shows how agents can receive and process file inputs (PDF, image, etc.).
- **Multi-file support**: Handles multiple files in a single prompt.
- **LLM file reasoning**: The agent is instructed to summarize or describe uploaded files concisely.

**Comparison:**
- Introduces file handling, which is not present in the no-tools or basic tool-calling examples.
- Useful for workflows where agents need to extract or summarize information from user-uploaded documents or images.
